If someone is rebroadcasting your live stream without permission, a DMCA takedown is the most effective legal step. Here's how streamers can file one:

1. Identify the infringing content and its URL.  
2. Gather proof that you own the original content.  
3. File a DMCA takedown claim with the platform hosting the content.  
4. Keep detailed records of each submission.  

Using **Live Shield**, this process is streamlined: claims are filed automatically and you receive a report showing all actions taken.
